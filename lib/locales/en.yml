    post_1_title: Higher engine wear? Regular oil changes can prevent this
    post_1_content: "<p>Every car needs engine oil to lubricate and cool all of its moving parts. Modern multi-range oils ensure low-friction motor running in summer as well as in winter. Higher engine wear can be easily avoided if the oil is changed at regular intervals. Regularly changing your car´s oil is not a luxury but a technical necessity.</p><p>Engine oil has a limited life</p><p>Engine oil keeps dirt particles, which are filtered out in the oil filter. An oil change should occur after a certain number of kilometers, but is also regularly required for cars with lower mileage. The oil enriches itself over time with corrosive particles, and the additives in the engine oil lose their effect. The viscosity also changes as the oil is increasingly diluted with condensation water after cold starts. The result is higher engine wear, which can ultimately lead to engine damage.</p><p>An oil change is good for the environment and your wallet</p><p>Anyone who gets regular oil changes, drives gently and doesn´t run the engine at high speed after a cold start can enjoy his vehicle for a longer time and avoid expensive repairs. In many cars, the time of the next oil change is calculated dynamically and signaled to the driver in the cockpit in good time. The driver avoids expensive repairs, and keeps the engine clean and profitable through low fuel consumption.</p><p>Without regular oil changes, expensive engine damage is a threat</p><p>Even for their own interests, drivers should not wait too long to get the next oil change. Higher engine wear is not visible from the outside, but leads to increased consumption, poorer gas exhaust values ​​and reduced power. However, higher engine wear can also be caused by incorrect viscosity or by the addition of already aged engine oil. Therefore, only high-quality multigrade oil from an unopened container should be used when changing the oil.</p>"
    post_2_title: Do regular oil changes increase the resale value?
    post_2_content: "<p>Buyers of used cars are more skeptical than ever. Used car dealers have always been critical and search used vehicles for hidden deficiencies and concealed vulnerabilities. Increasingly, private individuals are also bringing along a technically competent companion to scrutinize the vehicle offered for purchase. Do regular oil changes contribute to a better resale price?</p><p>Oil changes create trust</p><p>Even experienced hobbyists can´t look into the engine when buying a used car and get a picture of the condition of the connecting rod bearings or the piston rings. But anyone who is able to prove the dates of oil changes through entries in a service book improves their chances of a good sale price. Because when regular oil changes have been made, it´s clear to see the seller took care of their vehicle. The buyer is also interested in whether the owner has shown a reasonable and motor-friendly driving style.</p><p>Documentation is important</p><p>A car specialist company documents oil changes in the vehicle´s service book. Often, regular oil changes occur during large or small inspections and are noted together with the replacement of the oil filter and other small parts. But separate oil changes should also be documented by the specialist workshop.</p><p>Regular oil changes increase the vehicle value</p><p>A regular oil change pays twice. The owner benefits from a clean working engine, saves the environment and lowers fuel costs. In the case of resale, they have the evidence to convince the buyer that the engine is in good condition and still has a long running performance ahead. All of these are good reasons for regular oil changes.</p>"
    post_3_title: Regular oil changes help cars to live longer
    post_3_content: "<p>Without care and checks, a vehicle becomes not only unsightly, but also unreliable. Costly damage can only be avoided with regular maintenance. This also includes regular oil changes. Many drivers don´t just ask themselves: when should I change the oil? Some doubt whether an oil change is necessary at all. However, all motor oils are subject to a natural aging process - the quality of the lubricant is reduced over the years. There are other factors to consider.</p><p>In the cold season the fuel condenses and turns into a condensate on the piston walls, diluting the gasoline. Through abrasion, metallic particles get into the oil, corrode it and reduce its lubrication quality. Blow-by gases flowing past the piston rings contaminate the engine oil with combustion residues. As a result, not only does the lubrication deteriorate, so does the viscosity of the oil. This means that the oil no longer corresponds to the original specification – so lubrication and cooling deteriorate. Without regular oil changes, premature wearing of the engine is imminent.</p><p>The question remains: When to change the oil? The oil change intervals can be taken from the vehicle´s logbook and should be observed. Anyone who neglects an oil change must count on the following: the inevitable consequences are increased wear on all surfaces and bearings requiring lubrication. Contaminated spark plugs, corrosion damage on the oil pump and a prematurely worn catalytic converter are further unpleasant consequences. However, fuel consumption will also increase and the exhaust gas values ​​will become poorer. The exhaust gas purification system will no longer be able to completely filter the unburned foreign substances, which means that the catalyst and the environment are also heavier.</p><p>When it comes to determining times to change the oil, it is necessary to distinguish between fixed and dynamic alternating intervals. With fixed intervals, mileage and period are used. Dynamic change intervals are calculated by the on-board computer and displayed in the cockpit. The cost of neglecting the oil change intervals cannot be predicted reliably. If you're lucky, you can still travel miles with the old oil without causing any defects. However, wear and tear, increased operating costs and greater environmental impact are certain. If damage occurs, it can be quite costly for the driver. If you do not take any risks and want to enjoy your engine, you should take the oil change question seriously and never miss a regular oil change.</p>"
